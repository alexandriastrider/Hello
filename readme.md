<h1> About Me! <h1>
<h4> Hello, my name is Alexandria Strider. <h4>

<h7> A little about why I started this coding journey is to expand my computer knowledge and learn how to code. I've always loved playing on computers and learning new things, so why not put the two together and learn new things about computers.
